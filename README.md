- 👋 Hi, I’m @TrueCatalyst
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about blockchain technocologies and applying them to solve problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics. I studied supply chain managment in college and have worked in 3rd party logistics and project management since graduation. I am going through different tutorials in java, solidity, python, and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner and basic level concepts that can expand my understanding of blockchain technologies
- 📫 Learning the basic now so reach me on here and hopefully I can keep up.
